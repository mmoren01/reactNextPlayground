When I first saw how much could be done with **Markdown** I was impressed. I said to myself:
>*I need to learn __Markdown__ to go back and fix the `README.md` files on the public repositories on [my GitHub](www.github.com/mmoren01).*

So I made a list for myself because who doesn't love lists:
  - Learn Markdown
  - Practice using **Markdown** on my next blog entry
  - Update my reactPlayground repo's `README.md`

I learned some valuable lessons along the way, the most important being:

## Not all **Markdown** is created equal

There are different **Markdown** processors that allow you to do different things. So imagine my surprise when I learned that ~~this won't make these words appear strike through without the correct processor~~. I was disappointed to say the least. GitHub has some cool tricks that I wasn't able to demo for this post like lists with checkboxes and emojis.

It's a useful skill to have and something that could be picked up in less than an hour. It is a critical skill to have when presenting repositories on GitHub during the job search. I think I will look into employing a different processor for future posts.
